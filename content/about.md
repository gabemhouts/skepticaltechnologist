## about the site

On this site, I plan to write about topics of privacy, Cybersecurity and generally just taking in the world with a heavy does of techno-skepticism. Although the main target of the Skeptical Technologist is technology and privacy, it will also serve as a platform for me to write about my hobbies and interests. If you have something you’d like to see featured on the site, please don’t hesitate to contact us.

## why an Independent platform
You might ask, why publish the skeptical technologist on an independent site instead of on social media where it could be found easier? While its true that things get discovered more on social media, its good to have your own platform to speak. The internet is becoming more and more centralized, and I think breaking away from that and developing a personal platform for speech will be much more valuable than just another tweet from a tech nerd.

## about the author
My name is Gabe Houts. Born in the age of the internet, I have grown to know no other world than that of the mass information, hyper-connected one we live in now. I've always had a giant interest and love for technology. I can still remember the hours of sitting on my old Dell Inspirion laptop running windows XP trying to figure out the basics of HTML. Through the years I have gained a lot of technical skills, and without the internet my life would be immeasurably different. I can safely say, like many other people of my generation, that the internet, and technology in a whole, has formed us as people. The internet has provided me with countless amazing experiences. However, these experiences have also made me realized just how scary the internet can be. Every day we as people are loosing more and more of our privacy. Privacy is a basic human right, and its being invaded on a larger scale than we have ever seen. whether it be by private companies through the services we know and love, or by the government itself.
