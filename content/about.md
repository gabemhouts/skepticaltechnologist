## Hi there

My name is Gabe Houts. Born in the age of the internet, I have grown to know no other world than that of the mass information, hyper-connected one we live in now. I've always had a giant interest and love for technology. I can still remember the hours of sitting on my old Dell Inspirion laptop running windows XP trying to figure out the basics of HTML. Throughout the years I have gained a lot of technical skills, and without the internet my life would be immeasurably different. I can safely say, like many other people of my generation, that the internet and technology in a whole, has formed me as a person. The internet has provided me with countless amazing experiences. However, these experiences have also made me realize just how scary the internet can be. Every day we as people are losing more and more of our privacy. Privacy is a basic human right, and its being invaded on a larger scale than we have ever seen. Whether it be by private companies through the services we know and love, or by the government itself.

On this site, I plan to write about topics of privacy, Cybersecurity and generally just taking in the world with a heavy dose of techno-skepticism. Although the main target of the Skeptical Technologist is technology and privacy, it will also serve as a platform for me to write about my hobbies and interests. If you have something you’d like to see featured on the site, please don’t hesitate to contact us.

Since I strongly believe in online privacy, this site will have absolutely 0 trackers. The site will never have any cookies, and never log any IP addresses or any other data about its readers. The code for the site will also be publicly available for your analysis. You can view the code [here](https://github.com/gabemhouts/skepticaltechnologist) on GitHub.

Thank you for checking out the site, I hope you enjoy the Skeptical Technologist!
