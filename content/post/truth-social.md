## What is Truth Social?

More than a year after former president Trump was suspended indefinitely from Facebook and Twitter, his new social media platform “Truth Social” is set to be released publicly tomorrow, February 21. The platform is set to only be available on the Apple app store at the time of release. Truth social is self described as a platform hosting global conversation without discrimination against political ideology.

Truth Social opened for select beta testers recently, and was generally reported as slow and buggy. Screenshots of the app show an interface eerily similar to that of twitter, Trump's preferred platform during his candidacy and later administration. Beta testers were asked to post, like and repost other content to test the platform’s bandwidth, an experiment which made the app even slower.

## What Trump has to gain

Ever since his removal from Twitter and Facebook, Trump has been grasping for a way to galvanize his base. Because Trump is ultimately in control of the platform, he will presumably be immune to censorship like that he experienced with Twitter near the end of his presidency. This whole venture is theorized to simply be an attempt for former president Trump to reach his supporter base. The platform also allows his loyalist candidates and politicians to have a direct platform to interact with Trump's voters. Essentially, if you are a candidate Trump has supported, it will give you a means of appealing to the strong republican loyalists expected to be the main target of the platform. However, the effect will strongly depend on how successful the entire venture is.

## Why Truth Social is so dangerous

The internet serves as a powerful tool for politicians and citizens alike to discuss and share their political beliefs. Social media platforms, such as Twitter, have become filled with debates between users about current political happenings. An important part of maintaining a healthy narrative when discussing politics is providing users with exposure to cross speech. This means that users must be exposed to ideas and opinions other than their own. Without this vital exposure it creates a toxic environment that encourages the development of conspiracy. Debate is healthy, and helps prevent radical ideas from spreading. However, because of Trump's involvement in Truth Social it's unlikely that users will have any exposure to cross speech.

It's extremely dangerous for a social media platform to be run solely by a political entity. We can fully expect that thoughts and opinions other than that of Trump and his supported politicians will be suppressed on the platform. This means that the Republican and Trump supporter base will be even more radicalized by receiving all of their political discourse from a candidate run platform. I believe the environment will become toxic, and potentially be the source of many radical conspiracies working to the benefit of Trump and his benefactors.
